# About

Hi, I'm Tenzin, a software engineer from the land of 10,000 lakes.

Originally born in India to refugee parents, I remember playing with my first computer in my dad's office around the age of 9.

This is where I document my journey through cybersecurity, open source software, and startups.

## Outlook on Life

I start a lot of projects, and finish very few. I think it's essentially a numbers game.

It’s easy to come up with good ideas; execution is what matters most. Therein lies the rub — and the excitement.

### A personal favorite quote by the famous rough rider:

_“Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer much, because they live in the gray twilight that knows neither victory nor defeat.”_ - Theodore Roosevelt
