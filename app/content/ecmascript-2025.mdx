# ECMAScript 2025 Overview

I first heard of ECMAScript during my initial attendence of a Frontend Masters workshop with a senior software engineer from Bloomberg as host.

Although the day's course was mainly about all things Web Accessiblity with Chrome, I specifically remember his mentioning of TC39 piqueing my interest. After going down a rabbit hole of this technical commitee who oversees the development of JavaScript, yes your favorite browser language. I also found out that TC39 was just one part of a big organization based in Europe, that handled the specs of many other information and communication systems like XML, Dart Programming language, JSON, and even .NET.

ECMAScript 2025 introduces several impactful features to enhance JavaScriptâ€™s functionality and performance. It adds a new built-in global `Iterator` object that provides lazy-evaluated functional operators like `map`, `filter`, and `take` for all iterables, improving performance especially on large or streaming data. The `Set` class gains useful set theory methods such as `intersection`, `difference`, and `symmetricDifference`, along with relationship checks like `isSubsetOf`. JSON can now be imported directly as a module with simple syntax, eliminating extra tooling for local files. Regular expressions receive improvements with a new `RegExp.escape` method to safely handle dynamic patterns and inline flag syntax for applying flags to subpatterns. The new `Promise.try` method streamlines promise chains by wrapping synchronous and asynchronous operations consistently, simplifying error handling. Additionally, a new `Float16Array` typed array supports 16-bit floating point numbers, beneficial for memory-sensitive applications like machine learning. Overall, these updates deliver a balanced blend of performance, readability, and modern programming capabilities.
